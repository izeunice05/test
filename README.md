# Genetics Study Pipelines

You can find different pipelines for various past and ongoing projects in the lab. These archived pipeilnes include,

1. Admixture Mapping
2. Genotype Imputation
3. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
4. Polygenic Risk Score (PRS)
5. Tractor

For each pipeline, you should be able to find brief description on each method and example codes/scripts that you can run and reproduce the results. These pipelines are written in different programming languages including bash, perl, python, plink and R.
