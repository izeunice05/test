# Genetics Study Pipelines

You can find different pipelines for various past and ongoing projects in the lab. These archived pipeilnes include

1. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
2. Polygenic Risk Score (PRS)
3. Admixture Mapping
4. Genotype Imputation
5. Tractor

For each pipeline, you should be able to find brief description on each method and example codes/scripts that you can run and reproduce the results. These pipelines are written in different programming languages including bash, perl, python, plink and R.
